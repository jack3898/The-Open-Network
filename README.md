# The-Open-Network
I have created this for self-teaching purposes. If you stumble across this repository and see something I did wrong, or against convention let me know or submit a fix! My goal (even though this is a project for self teaching purposes) is to create an open source social media network. I don't want there to be any trackers. :)

No PHP libraries - this is a vanilla PHP site. Re-inventing the wheel to learn PHP.

Of course you will also need the database export to get this working! Download the latest one at:

It's just a dump of the one I use for my developments (it may also contain data from new branches). :p
