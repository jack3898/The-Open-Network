# The-Open-Network
I have created this for self-teaching purposes. If you stumble across this repository and see something I did wrong, or against convention let me know or submit a fix! My goal (even though this is a project for self teaching purposes) is to create an open source social media network. I don't want there to be any trackers. :)

No PHP libraries - this is a vanilla PHP site. Re-inventing the wheel to learn PHP.

Of course you will also need the database export to get this working! Download the latest one at:

It's just a dump of the one I use for my developments (it may also contain data from new branches). :p

Features:
- Create and log in to accounts securely
- Customise your profile to a basic degree
  - You can change your profile picture
  - You can change your profile banner
  - You can change your bio
- You can add/delete friends
- You can see posts made by you and your friends (at the moment you can only create posts directly in the DB)

To do:
- Create and edit posts
  - Let people add attachments and embed
- Customise more of your profile
- Have settings to have lots of control over the site visuals
- See who's online
- Search for people
- Integrate some third party API's so create links with other social media networks (I am thinking Discord and Twitter).
