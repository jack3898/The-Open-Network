# The-Open-Network
I have created this for self-teaching purposes. If you stumble across this repository and see something I did wrong, or against convention let me know or submit a fix! My goal (even though this is a project for self teaching purposes) is to create an open source social media network. I don't want there to be any trackers. :) P.S. You may find the passwords aren't hashed. Of course that will be changed in the future. They're not hashed simply because this site is not fully developed and it was quick!
